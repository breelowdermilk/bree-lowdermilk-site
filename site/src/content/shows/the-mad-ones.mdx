This contemporary and compelling score from one of NYC's most exciting new songwriting teams immerses audiences in the complex inner life of a young woman on the brink of change. When every choice feels like life and death, how do you turn the key? The Mad Ones (fka The Unauthorized Autobiography of Samantha Brown) opened off-Broadway November 17, 2017.
